Project: Multi-modal Document Intelligence System
This project will demonstrate your ability to work with cutting-edge AI/LLM technologies while leveraging your existing hardware to minimize costs.
Key Features:

Document Processing and Understanding:

Use open-source tools like Tesseract OCR for text extraction
Implement basic layout analysis using computer vision techniques (OpenCV)
Process text, images, and simple tables within documents


Semantic Search and Indexing:

Utilize sentence-transformers library for generating embeddings
Implement FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search
Create a hybrid search combining semantic and keyword-based approaches


Question Answering and Summarization:

Fine-tune an open-source language model (e.g., BERT or RoBERTa) for QA tasks
Implement extractive and abstractive summarization using HuggingFace Transformers


Generative AI Capabilities:

Integrate a locally runnable LLM like LLaMA 2 or BLOOM using LangChain
Implement few-shot learning techniques for task-specific generation


Multi-lingual Support:

Extend the system to handle documents and queries in 2-3 major languages
Implement cross-lingual embeddings for improved language understanding


Ethical AI and Explainability:

Implement basic bias detection using pre-trained fairness models
Provide simple explanations for AI-generated answers using attention visualization


Scalable Processing:

Design a multi-threaded processing pipeline to leverage your multi-core CPU
Implement efficient caching strategies for faster document retrieval


Model Fine-tuning:

Create a basic pipeline for fine-tuning models on domain-specific data
Use techniques like gradient accumulation to handle larger models on limited GPU memory
